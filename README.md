# Plotter code

A collection of simple code for playing around with my OpenBuilds Acro 55 plotter / laser engraver.

## Plotter hardware

* OpenBuilds ACRO 55 20" x 20" (https://openbuildspartstore.com/openbuilds-acro-55-20-x-20/)
* BlackBox Motion Control System (https://openbuildspartstore.com/blackbox-motion-control-system/)
* Pen lifter: EleksMakerÂ® Draw Module XY Plotter
* Laser: 450nm 3.5W Blue Laser Module TTL Modulation Fan Heat Sink for EleksMaker DIY Engraver 

## Software & grbl settings

I'm sending simple gcode to the "OpenBuilds CONTROL Machine Interface Controller" https://software.openbuilds.com/ 

The plotter pen is raised and dropped by controlling an RC servo. To use the system as a plotter, I first flashed my Blackbox motion controller with the "2 Axes + RC servo" machine style image found in the grbl flashing tool within OpenBuilds CONTROL. Then, the M3 command can be used to send out varying PWM signals to the RC servo. The settings that worked for me:

* Laser-mode ($32): disabled
* Maximum spindle speed, RPM ($30): 1000
* Minimum spindle speed, RPM ($31): 0

Note: For laser engraving, I bought "LightBurn" (https://lightburnsoftware.com/), which does an excellent job when importing vector or raster images and turning them into an engraving. It's not too convenient when using it for controlling the system when the plotter pen is installed, as it's optimized for laser systems.



## placement_grid.py

A simple script that creates gcode for drawing a rectilinear grid onto my plotter bed

Example:

Draw a 50mm-spaced grid for a 300mm x 300mm plotter bed:

```
python placement_grid.py 300 300 50 -v -o gcode_grid_300x300-50.gcode
```

The gcode file "gcode_grid_300x300-50.gcode" can then be opened in the OpenBuilds CONTROL software.

For options, type:

```
python placement_grid.py -h
```

## Perlin noise field

Script: perlin_noise_arrows.py
Subfolder: perlin_noise_field

A script to create 2D field of arrows, oriented using Perlin noise. (Uses: https://github.com/caseman/noise) 

It creates an SVG file, as well as a gcode file that describes the arrows. Here's a 30x30 example with default noise settings:

## Packing Circles
[OpenCV]: https://opencv.org/

Code to place circles of varying radii onto a binary image mask. Depends on OpenCV  (cv2 module in Python). Below is an example of a mask image of a snake, converted to a pattern of circles, which is exported as an SVG vector image:

![snake_example](/Users/armin/code/plotter_code/images/snake_example.png)


The command that produced the pattern is as follows:

```bash
python pack_circles.py masks/mask-snake.png -m 200 -n 1000 --r_min 3 --r_max 18 --offset 2 -i -o snake.svg
```



- -n ... number of circles that the script attempts to place
- -m ... number of attempts when placing a circle. 1000 in this example
- --r_min ... smallest circle radius in pixels
- --r_max ... largest circle radius in pixels
- --offset ... minimum number of pixels between two circles (default = 0)
- -i ... invert the mask, so that circles are placed on black areas. By default, circles are drawn on white areas
- -v ... be more verbose when running the command (for debugging)



Here is an example where r_min was set to 3, but r_max was changed from 12, to 18, to 25:

### Example of laser-cut stencil:

 It takes about 10 minutes to cut the paper stencil on my wimpy laser engraver, but it turned out nice. I added an offset of 3 to make sure the paper stays strong, and connections between circles don't break too easily. Pattern command:

```bash
pack_circles.py masks/mask_snake.png -i -n 1000 --r_min 2 --r_max 12 --offset 3 -m 150 -o snake_template.svg
```

### Algorithm

The script first finds allowable pixels to place circles. It then randomly picks an allowed coordinate and places circle $i$ with radius $r_i$, as long as $i < n$.  It checks two conditions:

1. Circle must fit within the mask (uses OpenCV)
2. Circle must not overlap any previously placed one

If any of these two conditions fails, a new coordinate is picked and another attempt is made. (It gives up after m attempts.) 

**Note:** This is a fairly dumb algorithm, so it gets very slow when trying to place more than a 1000 points or so, depending on how small and crowded the mask is. I tried adding an update mechanism to remove already placed circles from the mask (-u, --update option), but it doesn't seem to speed things up at all. Maybe not checking *all* other circles for overlap, but just near ones (which should be might help speed things up too, but I didn't have a need for any further optimization.
